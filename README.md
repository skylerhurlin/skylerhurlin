Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Skyler Hurlin, a current graduate student at Portland State University, getting my MS in Applied Data Science. I have a BA in economics and business from the University of British Columbia and a Database Design & SQL certificate from Portland Community College.

I have a year of experience in paid data analysis roles with additional volunteering experience, and am currently looking for full-time work remotely in Canada or on-site/hybrid in the Vancouver/Richmond area. I am a US citizen and am eligible to work in Canada without sponsorship.

I have experience in Python, SQL, Excel, Access, Tableau, and Power BI, and am confident working in any client or program. I am pursuing Microsoft's Power BI Analyst certificate as well.

Please reach out to me at skylerhurlin@gmail.com or LinkedIn at linkedin.com/in/skyler-hurlin/ if you're currently hiring for a data analytics role.

Thank you for browsing my work!
